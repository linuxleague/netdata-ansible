Internal Repository for General Task Management and per-User Sharable Snippets/Tools/whatever

## Purpose

This is an internal private repo that should only be used for primarily two things:

- As an internal Task Management tool where an existing repository does not make sense.
- As an internal storage area for various tools, snippets and tidbits that also do not belong anywhere else.

## Structure

The structure is pretty simple. There is precisely 1 directory per employee
UNIX/Github Username (_if it exists_); where you can do whatever you like. Just keep Git history clean,
commit messages sensible, etc.

See [prologic](/prologic)'s space as an example.

## Rules

- Any Issue __must__ be assigned.
- Do not touch anyone else's workspace without first asking; be courteous :)
- Do not fork this repo (_forking has been disabled_)
- Share everything! And have fun!

## Future Ideas

- Build a Slack bot that responds to:

> !task for prologic Build a Slack Task bot.

Or:

> !task for prologic #hi-pri ...
